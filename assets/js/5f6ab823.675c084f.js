Going from the most static way to be able to dynamically change it during rollout.\\r\\n\\r\\n## Import certificate through Dockerfile\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the most direct ways to get your certificate into your container is add it to your Dockerfile. Lets imagine you have a certifacte `my-certificate.cer`.\\r\\n\\r\\n```Dockerfile\\r\\nCOPY my-certificate.cer $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security\\r\\nRUN keytool -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit -noprompt -trustcacerts -importcert -alias my-cert -file $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/my-certificate.cer\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nThe above example assumes the following:\\r\\n\\r\\n - Your base image is Java based.\\r\\n - The default storepass is `changeit`. Change it if it is not.\\r\\n - `my-cert` is an example alias, use your own instead.\\r\\n\\r\\n## ConfigMap with a local cacerts\\r\\n\\r\\n## ConfigMap with certificates and Init-Container\\r\\n\\r\\n## Cluster Operator and Init-Container"}]}')}}]);
